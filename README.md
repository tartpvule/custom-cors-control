**Custom CORS Control** - Advanced user control for CORS

## Introduction

This extension aims to provide a user with complete control over the CORS mechanisms.

Misconfiguring the rules **WILL** break the protections offered by the Same-Origin Policy.

Only requests with an `Origin` header and a matching rule are modified at all by this extension.

## Configuration

**Warning** Read first: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS>, and <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_settings_attributes>.

```
{
  "Type1": {
    "Origin1": {
      "Target1": {
        "Path1": {
      	  "ACRH": [""],
      	  "ACAO": "allow",
      	  "ACEH": [""],
      	  "ACAC": false,
      	  "ACAM": ["GET", "POST"],
      	  "ACAH": [""]
      	}
      }
    }
  }
}
```
1. Request Type

	One of the request types as documented at <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest/ResourceType>.

	`*` matches everything, but only if no exact matches.

2. Origin

	Evaluated one-by-one against `details.origin` with `String#endsWith`, but `*` matches everything.

3. Target origin

	Evaluated one-by-one against the origin in `details.targetUrl` with `String#endsWith`, but `*` matches everything.

4. Path

	Evaluated one-by-one against the path in `details.targetUrl` with `String#startsWith`, but `*` matches everything.

* `ACRH`

	Array of values allowed to be present in the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header in preflight request.

	Headers not present in this array will be omitted from subsequent requests.

* `ACAO`

	`"allow"`: Set `Access-Control-Request-Headers: <origin>` in responses.

	`"star"`: Set `Access-Contorl-Request-Headers: *` in responses.

	`"block"`: Cancel all requests.

* `ACEH`

	An array of values allowed to be present in the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header in responses.

* `ACAC`

	Set `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header in responses to the specified boolean value.

	Omit `Authorization` and `Cookie` headers from actual requests.

* `ACAM`

	Array of allowed request methods. The request is canceled if not matched.

	For preflight requests, this is matched against `Access-Control-Request-Method`.

	For actual requests, this is matched against `details.method`.

* `ACAH`

	Array of values allowed to be present in the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` header in preflight responses.

## Default Rules

```
{
  "font": {
    "*": {
      "*": {
        "*": {
          "ACAO": "star",
          "ACAC": false,
          "ACAM": ["GET"]
      	}
      }
    }
  }
}
```
